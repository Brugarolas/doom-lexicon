// How credits work:
// C_MAPLUMPNAME = "authors here";
// 
// So for example:
// 
// C_MAP01 = "ID Software";
// 
// Would print "Credits: ID Software" on MAP01.
// The ACS Code does the rest for you.
// If there is not a define here for, say, MAP01, the ACS code will just print "C_MAP01" as the credits, showing that the define doesnt exist.


[default]
C_DIB01 = "AuthorName";

// again, finicky stuff, all lines must have a color tag at the beginning of the line followed by a space then the text eg: ### <text>
// colors work as follow: ### RGB 0-9 eg: 990 = yellow; 999 = white; 555 = gray; 099 = cyan; 950 = orange; ect...
// the size of the image is fixed, it wont resize if you add more stuff, you'll have to ask me to set the image size unfortunatlly
